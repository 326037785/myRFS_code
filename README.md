# myRFS_code

This repository is dedicated to converting the RFS code from Matlab to Python. As a Python rookie, I find inspiration and code snippets from the following sources:

1. **Source Codes:**
   - The original Matlab source codes are available at [http://ba-tuong.vo-au.com/codes.html]. I want to express my gratitude to Mr. VO for his excellent work.

2. **Python Implementation:**
   - I refer to the Python implementation of RFS available at [https://github.com/jacobnzw/MTT-Workshop]. The code provided by Jacobnzw is particularly helpful for rookies like me, and I appreciate his efforts in making it readable.

# Implementation Progress

I've made progress in implementing the RFS code in Python:

- Implemented the Single Tracker Gaussian Sum Filter and Bernoulli Filter.

I encountered some challenges in understanding the data structure "cell" in Matlab and adapting it to Python. Once I overcome this hurdle, I plan to submit the implementation for the cmember filter. Additionally, stay tuned for the upcoming implementation of the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF).

Thank you for following my progress, and I'm excited to share more updates soon!
